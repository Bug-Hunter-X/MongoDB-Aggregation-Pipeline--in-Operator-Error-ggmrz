# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline $in Operator Error
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB aggregation pipelines, specifically when dealing with arrays within documents.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, leading to unexpected results. The corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  This example highlights the importance of understanding how `$in` interacts with array-type fields in MongoDB.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a MongoDB instance and connect to it using a suitable MongoDB driver (e.g., the MongoDB Node.js driver).
3. Create a sample collection with documents that contain arrays in the field that you are querying.
4. Execute the code in `bug.js`. Observe the incorrect results.
5. Then, execute the code in `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected output.
