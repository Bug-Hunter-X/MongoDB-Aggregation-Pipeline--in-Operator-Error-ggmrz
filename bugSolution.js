```javascript
//Correct usage of $in operator in MongoDB aggregation pipeline
db.collection.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      'field': { $in: [1, 2, 3] }
    }
  }
]);
//In this case, $in operator is used correctly in the aggregation pipeline.
//This will return the documents where field is 1,2 or 3.
